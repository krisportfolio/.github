### Why "Reinventing the Wheel"?
Since my birth, I've been passionate about exploring and understanding technology by creating and modifying everything from scratch. This repository showcases my journey of reinventing the wheelâ€”building custom solutions, learning from the process, and pushing the boundaries of my knowledge.

Happy coding!
